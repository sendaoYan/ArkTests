 * -@TestCaseID: ThreadTest
 *- @TestCaseName: Thread_ThreadTest.java
 *- @RequirementName: Java Thread
 *- @Title/Destination: test yield() in thread. finally all thread finished running.
 *- @Brief: see below
 * -#step1: 创建两个ThreadYielding类的实例对象threadYielding1、threadYielding2，并且ThreadYielding类继承自Thread类；
 * -#step2: 分别调用threadYielding1、threadYielding2的start()方法启动这两个线程；
 * -#step3: 分别调用threadYielding1、threadYielding2的join()方法；
 * -#step4: 将类变量ThreadYielding.dim的值赋值给threadNum；
 * -#step5: 经判断得知，threadYielding1.count、threadYielding2.count的值与（threadNum / 2）的值相等；
