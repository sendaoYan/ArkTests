 * -@TestCaseID: ThreadStateSleep1
 *- @TestCaseName: Thread_ThreadStateSleep1.java
 *- @RequirementName: Java Thread
 *- @Title/Destination: Primary thread sleep second-level time, target thread has ended.
 *- @Brief: see below
 * -#step1: 创建四个ThreadStateSleep1类的实例对象threadStateSleep1、threadStateSleep2、threadStateSleep3、
 *          threadStateSleep4，并且ThreadStateSleep1类继承自Thread类；
 * -#step2: 分别调用threadStateSleep1、threadStateSleep2的start()方法启动这两个线程；
 * -#step3: 让当前线程休眠1000ms；
 * -#step4: 分别调用threadStateSleep3、threadStateSleep4的start()方法启动这两个线程；
 * -#step5: 经判断得知，线程threadStateSleep1的状态是"TERMINATED"的；另外线程threadStateSleep4的状态
 *          要么是"RUNNABLE"的，，要么是"TERMINATED"的，并且只能是两种情况中的一种；
